Consider a .db file with an SQLite tablename under the variable JOB_HISTORY_TABLE. The JOB_HISTORY_TABLE, contains the data: customer_id INTEGER, customer_name TEXT, customer_address TEXT, services TEXT, job_date TEXT, price REAL, duration REAL, employee TEXT. Each row describes a "Job". The datatable is connected via the python function "assistant.ask(query_string)", which takes an Sqlite query string as an argument and returns the response from the datatable.

# Output context
I have a Google sheet called all_data with the following columns: id,name,address,service,price,employees,duration,rate,points,correct_price.

Can you write a formula that will copy the sheet all_data, but remove the rows which have duration below 105? Also, filter out any rows that have a matching id in the sheet AttentionNeeded
